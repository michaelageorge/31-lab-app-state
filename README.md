### Description 
#### Assignment 1: Connect to a Store
* Take an existing component which puts out some random numbers when a div is clicked, and refactor it to use a Redux store instead of local state.
#### Assignment 2: Create a New Reducer
* Extend a working application that uses Redux for it's state management and add a new component with it's own reducer/actions. This new reducer will be able to also respond to actions that the other component fires.
